## 🆘 Quick Help

### I can't login to Firebase
→ Check `docs/SETUP.md` → "Troubleshooting" → "Auth domain not authorized"

### Scores aren't saving
→ Check browser console for errors
→ Verify user is logged in
→ Check Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules

### Git push rejected
→ Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`
→ Resolve conflicts
→ Try push again

### CI pipeline failing
→ Check GitHub Actions tab for error details
→ Usually a JavaScript syntax error
→ Run `node -c filename.js` locally to check

### Need more help?
→ Create GitHub Issue (once repo is set up)
→ Ask Platform team
→ Check documentation in `/docs/`
